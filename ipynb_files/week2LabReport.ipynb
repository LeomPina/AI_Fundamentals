        "This lab sheet aims to help us understand that there are many different search algorithms and some of them may get us more optimal results than others, depending on the objectives of the problem.\n",
        "So in this lab report, we will analyse three different tasks:\n",
        "1. Route planning problem\n",
        "2. 8-puzzle problem\n",
        "3. Maze solver\n",
        "\n",
        "Each one of these presents a real-world problem, in which the appropriate solution will be met by resorting to some of these algorithms.\n",
        "The introduced searching algorithms during this report are the following:\n",
        "1. A*\n",
        "2. Breadth-first\n",

        "In order to explain what a search problem really is, four topics were analysed during the lecture:\n",
        "1. State: For each city, it was assigned a respective number from 1 to 6.\n",
        "2. Action: The new (or current) state indicates the city we are in at the moment and the next state is the one we are about to travel to, in other words, our destination. For example, if we are in state 1 and the next one is number 3, we can say that 3 is the action, which means we travelled from 1 to 3.\n",
        "3. Goal test: We now check if our current state matches the final destination expected. For example, if our current state is 5 and the final destination is also 5.\n",
        "4. Path cost: This information is displayed in the graph shown above (Figure 1). We turn this into a 6x6 array, where a positive finite distance value takes place between any directly connected city pair, 0 for the current city and \"inf\" for unconnected pairs of cities.\n",

On the other hand, the uniform-cost algorithm calculated a different optimal route, by opting for one more city-state for its path, while displaying a higher runtime, nevertheless, it was able to get a lower total cost.\n",
        "Therefore, we can easily approve that the uniform-cost algorithm provided a better solution to this problem, probably due to the fact that this algorithm prioritizes state selection based on cost values (edge weights) in order to find the shortest path, which the other algorithms don't.\n",

        "This next task consists in solving the 8-puzzle problem, which is better described in \"Russell and Norvig 2021\".\n",
        "So the presented problem, illustrated below (Figure 2), presents a 3x3 panel composed of 8 tiles, each one numbered from 1 to 8 and an empty one, where the objective is, given a initial panel configuration, to find a way to turn that initial state into the final one, by placing all the numbered tiles in its correct position and order. It is important to highlight that in order to make moves, we must only use the available empty space so that one of its adjacent tiles can occupy it, by making moves such as, below, above, left or right. This should be accomplished by making the minimum possible number of moves.\n",

        "1. State: By using a 3x3 array composed of numbers from 1 to 8 and the letter \"E\" for the identification of the blank space, we could represent the initial state of the puzzle and also follow its continuous transformation until the final state.\n",
        "2. Action: So that we can implement more easily this solution, we could move only the blank tile down, up, to the left or right, instead of moving all the numbered tiles. In order to achieve this, we would also need to formulate conditions to validate which one of the available moves would be accepted for a certain state.\n",
        "3. Goal test: We need to check if the current state matches the goal state, that is, whether we have actually obtained the correct final state. A suitable example can be seen in Figure 2.\n",
        "4. Path cost: As 1 move corresponds to 1 cost unit, the total path cost can be measured in the number of moves made throughout the solution of the problem.\n",

When using H2, the A\\* and Greedy algorithms showed a slightly better runtime than the others. At the same time, When using H1, we can also see that the A\\* and Greedy algorithms performed somewhat better.

However, the Greedy algorithm wasn't capable to run successfully, outputting a runtime error in both scenarios (with H1 and H2). Consequently, this leads us to accept that the A\\* outperforms the Greedy algorithm for this case scenario. This is probably due to the fact that the Greedy method has a lack of optimality, backtracking and its heuristic methods can lead to non-optimal outcomes when compared to A\\*.\n",

        "This last task introduces a maze problem, where the solution is obtained by finding the optimal (shortest) path, from a starting point to a given destination. The initial position is labelled in the maze map with an \"O\" and the target position is labelled with an \"X\". At the same time, the maze is also composed of other symbols, such as the \"#\" to represent the walls', which means the player can't go through them and must only use the empty spaces to move. The image below (Figure 3) presents an example of a maze, as described previously.  \n",

        "1. State: The player's current location on the map, which uses x and y coordinates, represents a new state.\n",
        "2. Action: We can only move down, up, left or right to another adjacent blank space, in other words, we can't move to the wall (\"#\") position. Even though we have defined the actions in order to extend the search, we'll add four diagonal moves, up right, down right, down left and up left, which grants us four more actions.\n",
        "3. Goal test: We must check if the current state position matches the target state (the coordinates are equal).\n",
        "4. Path cost: Any of the basic moves (up, down, left or right) mentioned correspond to 1 cost unit. However, diagonal moves (up right, down right, down left or up left) correspond, according to the Pythagorean theorem, to a square root of cost 2, which is approximately 1.4. That being said, the total path cost can be determined by calculating all the moves made and their cost, during the completion of the maze.\n",

        "By studying the tables above, we can verify that, when not using H1, the results generated by the algorithms used are all very similar, as we get the solution with 33 moves, a path cost of 33 units and also very close runtime values. Since we didn't use a heuristic function at first, every move as the same cost value, which means that the algorithms are only going to take into consideration the structure of the maze and the basic moves, which means that no particular path will be prioritized. However, when using H1 we can notice an increase in performance quality, as the A\\*, Greedy, Breadth-first and uniform-cost algorithms are now able to complete the maze and come up with a solution with just 23 moves and a path cost of approximately 26.999, so less moves and consequently a lower path cost.\n",
        "\n",
        "On the other hand, the Depth-first algorithm when submitted to these new conditions, showed negative results, as its solution was accomplished with 38 moves and a path cost of approximately 49.599. This is probably due to the fact that this algorithm is an uninformed search algorithm, which means that, it doesn't take into account the cost values to get to the solution, it's not actually designed to find the optimal solution (shortest path) and although H1 is a suitable heuristic for this problem, this algorithm does not benefit from it and in this case, it even causes suboptimal outcomes.\n",
        "\n",
        "It's important to notice that the A\\* method performed better with the H1 function, because these heuristics actually support its conditions for optimality, specifically the admissibility (never overestimate the cost) and the consistency (the triangle inequality) which is probably why this algorithm would most likely perform better than the others in a more complex test case.\n",

        "#Conclusion\n",
        "\n",
        "In conclusion, after completing this Lab work by solving its tasks and problems, we can say that, predominantly, the A* algorithm proved itself to perform better than the others, regarding the addressed problems. This advantage shown by this algorithm, can be explained by the structure of its method and appropriate heuristics, as it always tries to find the best possible solution (optimal solution).\n",
        "\n",
        "In further investigations, we could use other (more complex) search algorithms along with more challenging test cases, experiment with new and different heuristic functions and continue to explore new problem-solving strategies, hence boosting the performance and results of all these search algorithms."
