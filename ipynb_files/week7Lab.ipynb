        "This lab sheet aims to help us understand more about natural language processing, as we are going to study this\n",
        "new topic, and use it to solve 3 problems, which will be divided into the following tasks:\n",
        "1. The sentiment analysis problem\n",
        "2. The text classification problem\n",
        "3. The topic modelling problem\n",
        "\n",
        "## Task 6.1 Sentiment Analysis\n",
        "###Problem Description\n",
        "\n",
        "This first task presents us with a sentiment analysis problem, in which we will take movie reviews, and perform a sentiment analysis of these reviews. This task is also known as the “Hello World” problem for NLP (natural language\n",
        "processing). Despite its popularity, it is still difficult to perform this analysis, while getting almost flawless results and performances, as there are many \"human attributes\" to writting, such as sarcasm, slang, and other writing techniques or styles that make it hard for the computer to fully understand and process.\n",
        "\n",
        "In order to solve this task, we will use a dataset called \"movie_reviews\" (from the nltk corpus), which contains 1000 positive reviews, as well as 1000 negative ones.\n",
        "\n",
        "The following figure shows us an excerpt of a review, as an example of the type of language and writing used in the reviews presented in this dataset.\n",
        "\n",
        "![Figure 1](https://github.com/LeomPina/AIreports/blob/main/w7_6.1.1.png?raw=true)\n",
        "\n",
        "Figure 1\n",
        "\n",
        "In our implemented solution for this problem, we will use the simple word count features, as we will count the occurrence of each word in the document, such as \"tf\" and \"tf-idf\", in which \"tf\" stands for term frequency, and \"idf\" for inverse document frequency. We can see how to calculate these features in the figure below taken from the lecture.\n",
        "\n",
        "![Figure 2](https://github.com/LeomPina/AIreports/blob/main/w7_6.1.2.png?raw=true)\n",
        "\n",
        "Figure 2\n",
        "\n",
        "By using this technique, we are going to use one-hot vectors, which contain a binary representation of the words processed (for each word the vector representation is all 0s except for a 1 value), and then accumulate these one-hot vectors to create a new vector that has got all the frequencies of existing words in that document.\n",
        "\n",
        "We will also use the Naïve Bayes method, as we used in a previous lab task, except in this task we will use the multinomial model, which uses a different model for probability distribution than the one previously used. This method will be necessary for text classification, in this case, to classify the reviews as positive or negative.\n",

            "jerry springer has got nothing on \" wild things . \" \n",
            "john mcnaughton's new thriller tackles more tawdry themes in less than two hours than springer's notoriously sleazy talk show broadcasts in two weeks -- bisexuality , threesomes , poolside catfights , slutty rich bimbos , even redneck gator-wrestling , they're all part of the movie's raucous , complex storyline . \n",
            "but even trash tv topicality can't drag \" wild things \" down -- this crazy campfest plays like something you'd find late-night on the usa network , only infinitely more palatable and with a solid ensemble cast . \n",
            "despite a smattering of needless scenes ( most of them sexual in nature ) , there's wicked fun to be had here . \n",
            " \" wild things \" would be a guilty pleasure , only there's no guilty feeling involved in having a good time with it . \n",
            "high school guidance counselor sam lombardo ( matt dillon ) is well-liked in the town of blue bay , especially by pretty , popular kelly van ryan ( denise richards ) , whose family name is among the florida yachting enclave's most financially prominent . \n",
            "hoping to take her crush to a physical level , kelly seductively slinks into lombardo's house after washing his jeep for a fundraiser , but , the very next day , tearfully admits to her trollop mother ( theresa russell ) that she was raped . \n",
            "before long , blue bay detectives ray duquette ( kevin bacon ) and gloria perez ( daphne rubin-vega ) are listening to similar allegations from kelly's rebel classmate suzie toller ( neve campbell ) . \n",
            "lombardo , who maintains his innocence , hires neck brace-sporting , opportunistic lawyer ken bowden ( bill murray ) to defend him in court . \n",
            "the previews give away the following revelations , so if you haven't seen any of the movie's spots on the television or in the theater , you might want to skip to the next paragraph . \n",
            "while cross-examining suzie on the witness stand , bowden gets her to break down and admit that the alleged rapes never took place -- that kelly had concocted this entire scheme because she was angry that lombardo was sleeping with her mother and not with her . \n",
            "to pay lombardo for the damages , kelly's mother breaks her daughter's trust fund and gives him $8 . 5 million . \n",
            "but lombardo , kelly and suzie are actually all working together , and plan to take the money and run as fast as they can . \n",
            "duquette and perez , however , begin to suspect that there's more afoot to the case than just false accusations . \n",
            "if there's a major drawback to \" wild things , \" it's that it's oversexed to a fault . \n",
            "the much-talked-about hotel room menage-a-trois between dillon , campbell and richards is a turn-off . \n",
            "it's also cut short ( sorry , guys ) , and should have been cut shorter -- the movie grinds to a halt for pure titillation once too often . \n",
            "what we don't see is far more effective than what we do . \n",
            "another example of this is kevin bacon needlessly going the full monty in a shower scene . \n",
            "er , no thanks . \n",
            "also , bacon's duquette feels simultaneously underdeveloped and overwritten . \n",
            "daphne rubin-vega , from broadway's \" rent , \" tries to compensate for a superfluous character . \n",
            "theresa russell is just plain wooden . \n",
            "and when , in the end , all is out in the open , ask yourself if certain scenes involving these three were really necessary . \n",
            "but what keeps the movie from being throwaway junk is an engaging chain of surprises ( some predictable , some not ) that never seems to end . \n",
            " \" wild things \" has more twists than a crate full of corkscrews , and most are so gleefully , over-the-top nasty that you can't help but be charmed by their absurd showmanship . \n",
            "a great deal of amusement also comes from watching bill murray in a supporting part that appears to have been written for his sly comedic talent ; murray's a stitch , especially when pulling up beside the van ryan limo after winning lombardo's case and flipping them off . \n",
            "and don't leave when the closing credits hit the screen , or you'll miss the film's best part -- four bonus flashbacks that smooth over plot holes while offering a few more tiny turns , plus a final scene that caps everything off with a great stunner of a bombshell . \n",
            "speaking of bombshells , denise richards , who plays almost every scene in a blue bikini top , does the teen tease thing with a malicious allure that she was never allowed to flaunt in \" starship troopers . \" \n",
            "matt dillon flexes his sleepy-voiced sex appeal , and pulls off personality changes with chameleonic precision . \n",
            "neve campbell , lovely as ever except when sporting a blond wig , gives suzie a vengeful vulnerability that makes her the most interesting member of the conspiring trio . \n",
            "re-edited and toned down a bit , the dynamics between these three actors could have carried the film to greater lengths . \n",
            "but what we're given works well enough . \n",
            " \" wild things \" is highly entertaining and , indeed , very wild . \n",

Notice that this package was already used in a previous lab. The online documentation can be found at https://scikit-learn.org/stable/user_guide.html.\n",

Meanwhile, 61% of the positive instances were successfully identified (as the recall value for this instance is 0.61), while 93% of the negative instances were successfully identified. Moreover, we can see that the overall accuracy was 0.76, which means that 76% of the elements in the testing set were correctly classified (as positive or negative).\n",

Some possible reasons for this similarity in results are, for example, the small and common vocabulary in these reviews, or even the possible high similarity between most reviews in this dataset.\n",

So in this problem, we will use this method to discover these underlying topics, as well as their word distribution (supporting words), which can be done by maximizing the likelihood of observing the given data, given the topics and words. It is also important to note that this method does not need to have the knowledge about any topics in the documents.\n",

        "By analysing the previous results, we can see that the LDA model identified 2 different topics, where each of the words related, as shown above, have a significant weight to contribute to identifying the correspondent topic, so in this case, the words or terms related to artificial intelligence can be seen in \"topic 0\" and ones related to football can be seen in \"topic 1\".

By doing so, we gained additional knowledge on how these tools and methods can be applied to solve natural language processing problems, and how these can be useful for different scenarios.\n",
